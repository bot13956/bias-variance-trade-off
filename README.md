# bias-variance-trade-off

Bias-variance trade-off is a key concept in evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm. 
An overly simplified model suffers from underfitting (high bias) while a highly complex model suffers from overfitting (high variance). 
This example illustrates the bias-variance trade-off effect.
